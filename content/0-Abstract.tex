Topic Models are capable of discovering the latent structure of large Corpora. There are various Models that can be used for creating a Topic Model. One of those Models is the Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Topic Model, that have been created with the Latent Dirichlet Allocation are numerical distributions. However, those numerical distributions are hard to interpret, just by exploring the output. A way to visualize those numerical values could enhance the interpretation a lot. There are several methods to visualize Topic Models, which are presented in this article. These can be organized as static and interactive visualization. The described methods for the static visualization are the heatmap and the network. For an interactive visualization of the Topic Model the LDAvis system and a Topic Browser is presented. The last chapter contains the creation of a Topic Model on the 20Newsgroup dataset.  The 20Newsgroup dataset is a popular dataset for experiments in text applications of machine learning techniques. The created Topic Model is then visualized using a heatmap and the LDAvis system. It is possible to improve the interpretability of Topic Models with those visualizations. Nevertheless, the visualization gets confusing for large Topic Models.
